      <h2>CS200: Programming I</h2>
      <p class="courses">
        Learn the process of incrementally developing small (200-500 lines)
        programs along with the fundamental Computer Science topics. These
        topics include: problem abstraction and decomposition, the
        edit-compile-run cycle, using variables of primitive and more complex
        data types, conditional and loop-based flow control, basic testing and
        debugging techniques, how to define and call functions (methods), and IO
        processing techniques. Also teaches and reinforces good programming
        practices including the use of a consistent style, and meaningful
        documentation. Intended for students who have no prior programming
        experience.
      </p>
      <h2>CS300: Programming II</h2>
      <p class="courses">
        Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming using classes and objects to
        solve more complex problems. Introduces array-based and linked data
        structures: including lists, stacks, and queues. Programming assignments
        require writing and developing multi-class (file) programs using
        interfaces, generics, and exception handling to solve challenging real
        world problems. Topics reviewed include reading/writing data and objects
        from/to files and exception handling, and command line arguments. Topics
        introduced: object-oriented design; class vs. object; create and define
        interfaces and iterators; searching and sorting; abstract data types
        (List,Stack,Queue,PriorityQueue(Heap),Binary Search Tree); generic
        interfaces (parametric polymorphism); how to design and write test
        methods and classes; array based vs. linked node implementations;
        introduction to complexity analysis; recursion.
      </p>
      <h2>CS400: Programming III</h2>
      <p class="courses">
        The third course in our programming fundamentals sequence. It presumes
        that students understand and use functional and object-oriented design
        and abstract data types as needed. This course introduces balanced
        search trees, graphs, graph traversal algorithms, hash tables and sets,
        and complexity analysis and about classes of problems that require each
        data type. Students are required to design and implement using high
        quality professional code, a medium sized program, that demonstrates
        knowledge and use of latest language features, tools, and conventions.
        Additional topics introduced will include as needed for projects:
        inheritance and polymorphism; anonymous inner classes, lambda functions,
        performance analysis to discover and optimize critical code blocks.
        Students learn about industry standards for code development. Students
        will design and implement a medium size project with a more advanced
        user-interface design, such as a web or mobile application with a GUI
        and event- driven implementation; use of version-control software.
      </p>
      <h2>CS220: Data Science Programming I</h2>
      <p class="courses">
        Introduction to Data Science programming using Python. No previous
        programming experience required. Emphasis on analyzing real datasets in
        a variety of forms and visual communication.
      </p>
      <h2>CS240: Introduction to Discrete Mathematics</h2>
      <p class="courses">
        Basic concepts of logic, sets, partial order and other relations, and
        functions. Basic concepts of mathematics (definitions, proofs, sets,
        functions, and relations) with a focus on discrete structures: integers,
        bits, strings, trees, and graphs. Propositional logic, Boolean algebra,
        and predicate logic. Mathematical induction and recursion. Invariants
        and algorithmic correctness. Recurrences and asymptotic growth analysis.
        Fundamentals of counting.
      </p>
      <h2>CS252: Introduction to Computer Engineering</h2>
      <p class="courses">
        Logic components built with transistors, rudimentary Boolean algebra,
        basic combinational logic design, basic synchronous sequential logic
        design, basic computer organization and design, introductory machine-
        and assembly-language programming.
      </p>
      <h2>STAT240: Data Science Modeling I</h2>
      <p class="courses">
        Introduces reproducible data management, modeling, and analysis through
        a practical, hands-on case studies approach. Topics include the use of
        an integrated statistical computing environment, data wrangling, the R
        programming language, data graphics and visualization, random variables
        and concepts of probability, data modeling, and report generation using
        R Markdown with applications to a wide variety of data to address
        open-ended questions.
      </p>
      <h2>STAT340: Data Science Modeling II</h2>
      <p class="courses">
        Teaches how to apply statistical methods to learn from data. Topics
        include one- and two-sample inference; an introduction to Bayesian
        inference and associated probability theory; linear and logistic
        regression models; the bootstrap; and cross-validation. An integrated
        statistical computing environment is used to explore and analyze data,
        develop models, make inferences, and communicate results in a
        reproducible manner through a project-oriented approach to learning.
